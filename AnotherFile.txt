Here is a new file.

It’s me, Chris.  I add some new stuff up here on testFeatureBranch-Chris-1.  Eventually I am going to see how to migrate my change over to testFeatureBranch-Integration.

I am adding this text on master. (this was “HEAD” in conflict markers)
I am adding this line of text on the testFeatureBranch. (this was “Added a line on testFeatureBranch” in conflict markers)

OtherDev adds a change here on his branch off testFeatureBranch

Now some other people have been working on the branch testFeatureBranch…
