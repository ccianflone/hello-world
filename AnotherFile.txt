Here is a new file.


I am adding this text on master. (this was “HEAD” in conflict markers)
I am adding this line of text on the testFeatureBranch. (this was “Added a line on testFeatureBranch” in conflict markers)

I’ll edit this.
So if I have some edits here, will the stash wipe it out?

Here are a bunch of new edits on Monday, September 26, 2016.  I want to test how to temporarily get older branches so just adding some newer content here for now.
